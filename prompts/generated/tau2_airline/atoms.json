        "103": "Analyze the user's request for intent(s), policy exceptions, missing prerequisites, and mid-dialogue goal shifts, then select and sequence the minimal necessary agent/tool calls (e.g., identify user -> fetch reservation(s) -> take compliant action or request missing info) while maintaining state across focus changes to reach completion.",
        "104": "Analyze the user's message for intent(s), policy exceptions, and conversation state shifts, then route to the minimal correct tool/agent sequence (e.g., identity -> reservation retrieval -> action or follow-up) while prompting only for missing information and adapting if the goal changes mid-dialogue.",
        "105": "Act as a rigorous operations scientist and, for each user message, decompose it into explicit sub-tasks (including parallel threads for each intent), maintain and update workflow state across turns and interruptions, and produce the minimal correct sequence of backend actions (retrieval before execution, repeating fetches when context changes) needed to complete the interaction policy-compliantly.",
        "106": "Decompose each airline customer message into explicit intents and required backend tool-action sequences (spawning parallel threads for new vs. interrupted topics), retrieve mandatory user/reservation context before attempting any resolution, track conversational state across turns, and output only the minimal expected outcome tokens/actions in the exact required format without extra text."

        "102": "Rigorously critique the agent's reasoning by checking that each step is justified by the user's intent and airline policy, that required identifiers are retrieved via the correct tools before any action, that multi-turn context switches are handled without skipping/duplicating necessary calls, and that no unstated assumptions or rule-bypassing explanations are accepted.",
        "103": "Critique the assistant's reasoning like a careful teacher by checking that it correctly infers user intent, calls the required tools in the right order (requesting missing IDs when needed), follows airline policy constraints despite user excuses, maintains state across context switches, and flags any missing steps, unsupported assumptions, or incorrect actions.",
        "104": "Critique the assistant's reasoning by decomposing the user's request into explicit steps, verifying each step's logical validity and policy/tool-sequencing compliance, checking for unstated assumptions or missing required information, and flagging any mathematical or procedural errors."

    "100": "Final Answer: For each MedQA vignette, explicitly extract and verify key clinical clues, map them to the most likely diagnosis/pathophysiology, rule out close distractors by checking contraindications/guidelines/embryology facts, and then choose the single best option while flagging and correcting any unsupported assumptions.",
    "101": "Final Answer: Decompose each MedQA vignette by (1) extracting key discriminative clinical clues, (2) mapping them to the most likely diagnosis/mechanism via pathophysiology and guidelines/contraindications, (3) eliminating distractors with explicit rule-based justification",
    "102": "Final Answer: Analyze each MedQA vignette step-by-step by (1) summarizing the key clinical clues, (2) naming the most likely diagnosis/mechanism those clues imply, (3) recalling the relevant guideline/embryology/pharmacology fact (including contraindications), and (4) eliminating distractors to choose the single best option and briefly justify why it fits better than the alternatives.",
    "103": "Final Answer: Analyze the vignette for required inference depth (pattern recognition vs multi-step diagnosis\u2192mechanism/guideline\u2192best next step), then route to the appropriate agent (diagnosis, management/guidelines, embryology/pathophysiology, or contraindication-elimination) while enforcing strict option-based selection and returning only the final choice in the required format.",
    "104": "Final Answer: Analyze the medical question to decide whether it primarily requires (1) straightforward recall, (2) clinical vignette pattern recognition plus guideline-based management, or (3) multi-step reasoning (diagnosis \u2192 mechanism/contraindications \u2192 best next step), then route to the agent best suited for that level while explicitly identifying the key clues and ruling out common distractors.",
    "105": "Decompose each clinical MCQ into parallel steps: extract key symptoms/signs and context, map them to the most likely diagnosis/pathophysiology, retrieve the relevant guideline/first-line management or embryologic mechanism, eliminate distractors by contrasting hallmark features/contraindications, and then select the best option with a brief justification.",
    "106": "Final Answer: Decompose each MedQA item into parallel threads (clinical syndrome identification from clues, guideline/knowledge retrieval for management/etiology, and systematic option-by-option elimination including contraindications/age/pregnancy nuances), then reconcile threads into a single best answer with a brief justification anchored to the key discriminating finding."

  "verifier": {
    "100": "Final Answer: Critique the solver\u2019s reasoning step by step by extracting the vignette\u2019s key clinical cues, checking each inference against standard medical knowledge/guidelines, identifying missed differentials or contraindications, and verifying that the chosen option is the single best next step/mechanism while explicitly pointing out any logical leaps or unsupported assumptions.",
    "101": "Final Answer: Scrutinize the solution step-by-step by extracting key clinical cues, testing alternative diagnoses/management choices (including contraindications and guideline priorities), checking each inference for missing evidence or logical leaps, and explicitly flagging any incorrect assumptions or mismatches between findings and the selected option.",
    "102": "Final Answer: As a meticulous medical-domain verifier, scrutinize the solution\u2019s vignette cue extraction, differential exclusion, and guideline/embryology-based \u201cbest next step\u201d choice, explicitly flagging any logical leaps, missed contraindications (e.g., pregnancy safety), or mismatches between presentation and selected option.",
    "103": "Final Answer: Rigorously verify each step by explicitly mapping every vignette clue to the proposed diagnosis and then to the guideline-consistent best option, checking for omitted differentials, contraindications (e.g., pregnancy/age), embryology-to-presentation mismatches, and any unsupported assumptions or logical leaps.",
    "104": "Final Answer: Critique the solution by checking that the diagnosis and \u201cbest next step\u201d choice follow from the key vignette clues (timing, risk factors, safety/guidelines, embryology-to-presentation), explicitly rule out major distractors, and flag any unsupported assumptions or formatting/constraint violations."

  "answerer": {
    "100": "Provide only the selected option letter and exact answer text in one line (e.g., \u201cD: Nitrofurantoin\u201d), double-checking that it matches the question\u2019s key clinical cues and ruling out common distractors before responding.",
    "101": "Respond with only the single best choice in the format \u201c<Option Letter>. <Exact Answer Text>\u201d and nothing else.",
    "102": "Provide only the correct option letter followed by a colon and the exact answer text, with no explanation or additional content.",
    "103": "Final Answer: When multiple candidate answers conflict, independently re-derive the solution from the original prompt (extract key clinical cues \u2192 map to diagnosis/mechanism \u2192 apply guidelines/contraindications), cross-check each option for internal consistency and evidence-based fit, and then select the single best-supported answer while explicitly discarding plausible distractors.",
    "104": "Final Answer: When multiple candidate answers disagree, explicitly restate the key clinical cues, map them to the most specific diagnosis/mechanism and guideline-consistent management, cross-check against the exact option wording, and choose the single best-supported choice while briefly noting why close distractors are incorrect."

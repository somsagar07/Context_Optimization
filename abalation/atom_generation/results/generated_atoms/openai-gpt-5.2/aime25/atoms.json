    "100": "Think step-by-step by identifying the governing structure (e.g., modular constraints, similarity/area scaling, or integer compositions), translating the problem into algebraic relations, exhaustively but efficiently enumerating cases under all inequalities/divisibility conditions, and verifying the result with an independent check or alternate approach.",
    "101": "Final Answer: Reason step by step like a teacher by translating the problem into precise algebraic/geometric/combinatorial constraints, selecting the key theorem or structure, systematically handling all cases without omission, and verifying the final result against the original conditions.",
    "102": "Final Answer: Solve the problem by writing a clear step-by-step chain of symbolic deductions (algebra/geometry/combinatorics as appropriate), explicitly tracking all constraints and cases, using modular/ratio/counting arguments when needed, and finish with only the final value in the required format without any extra text.",
    "103": "Final Answer: As an expert mathematician, quickly classify the problem\u2019s domain (number theory/base representation, geometry/area transformations, or combinatorics/counting with constraints), identify the key invariants and required computations/casework, and route it to the specialized solver best suited to execute the full exact solution accurately.",
    "104": "Final Answer: Analyze the problem to identify its primary domain (number theory/base representation, geometry/area transformations, or combinatorics/counting with inequalities), translate the wording into a precise formal model (equations/invariants/casework), and route it to the corresponding specialized solver that can execute exact symbolic/algebraic computations without overcounting or arithmetic error.",
    "105": "Decompose the problem into parallel sub-tasks (formalize the statement into equations/constraints, solve each component via rigorous algebra/geometry/combinatorics with explicit casework and invariants, then verify and combine results into a single exact integer answer with consistency checks at each step).",
    "106": "Final Answer: Decompose each problem into explicit subtasks (parse and restate constraints; choose the appropriate method\u2014number theory/base conversion, geometry via coordinates/ratios/reflections/areas, or combinatorics via casework and counting; solve each subpart with careful validation of all inequalities and domain conditions; recombine results into a single integer) and enforce exact arithmetic and strict output formatting with no extraneous text."

  "verifier": {
    "100": "Final Answer: Critically verify each step by re-deriving the setup from the problem statement, testing alternative interpretations and edge cases, checking algebra/geometry/combinatorics invariants and counting for omissions or double-counting, and confirming the final result with an independent method or consistency check, explicitly flagging any unsupported leaps or arithmetic errors.",
    "101": "Final Answer: Rigorously verify each step of the solution for correct translation from the problem statement into equations/invariants, valid casework and counting without over/undercounting, exact algebra/geometry/divisibility logic and arithmetic (including modular conditions), and confirm the final output is a single correctly formatted integer with no unstated assumptions or skipped justifications.",
    "102": "Act as a rigorous verifier: restate the problem formally, check each inference step-by-step for correctness and completeness, test edge cases and counting/geometry/divisibility constraints, and either confirm the final result or pinpoint the first invalid step with a corrected derivation.",
    "103": "Final Answer: Act as a meticulous competition mathematician and rigorously verify each step of the proposed solution by checking translations from notation to algebra/geometry/combinatorics, validating all assumptions and casework for completeness, testing arithmetic/modular/divisibility and area-ratio invariants, and explicitly flagging any logical gaps, miscounts, or unjustified conclusions.",
    "104": "Final Answer: Critique the proposed solution step-by-step like a careful teacher by verifying each translation from the problem statement into mathematical expressions, checking every algebraic/geometry/combinatorics inference for hidden assumptions or overcounting, testing key constraints with small or edge cases, and confirming the final arithmetic matches the required output."

    "100": "Final Answer: Output only the final result (typically a single integer), with no explanations, steps, labels, or extra text.",

    "102": "As an expert mathematician, output only the final answer (typically a single integer) with no steps, explanation, or extra text.",
    "103": "Final Answer: When combining multiple candidate results, select the final answer by systematically verifying each one against the original problem\u2019s constraints and invariants, recomputing any nontrivial steps to catch arithmetic/logic slips, rejecting any answer that relies on unstated assumptions or inconsistent intermediate values, and using independent cross-checks (e.g., modular checks, boundary cases, or alternative derivations) to break ties.",
    "104": "Final Answer: When multiple candidate answers or sub-results conflict, identify the shared definitions and constraints, validate each option by recomputing the key steps (favoring invariant/constraint checks over surface agreement), discard any result that violates the problem conditions, and output the unique value that remains consistent with all verified reasoning."
